  Legend:   [+] added;   [-] deleted;   [*] changed;   [!] fixed;
------------------------------------------------------------------

2021-06-18, v0.5.1
  [+] Syntax files: the table-parameter of the Class function can have the field "firstline",
      e.g. firstline="lua". When a file is opened in the Far editor, the plugin reads its first
      line and if that line contains highlight:<syntax> (e.g. highlight:lua) then this file is
      highlighted according to this "Class". If this is the case the file extension is ignored.
  [*] Menu "Select syntax": added shortcuts 1...9, 0, A...Z for ease of selecting a syntax.

2020-10-31, v0.5.0
  [+] Syntax files: colors may be specified by names, e.g. "red" or "yellow on blue".
      Numeric color values also work.

2016-04-20, v0.4.5
  [+] Syntax Menu: add the item "Highlight OFF" and a separator.
  [*] Choosing a syntax from Syntax Menu acts as if the file was just open in the editor
      (discards all changes that might be made to current file settings).
  [+] Syntax files: the table-parameter to Class() may contain a (number) 'fastlines' parameter
      that overrides the configuration setting for the given class.
  [+] Syntax files: add syntax_intel_hex.lua.

2015-05-02, v0.4.4
  [!] Fix "attempt to index a nil value" error when a highlighted editor was
      open but not active and ACTL_REDRAWALL was called by another plugin.

2015-04-29, v0.4.3
  [!] Fix application hanging when the syntax is empty.
  [!] Lrexlib: fix crash bug in Oniguruma binding.

2015-04-26, v0.4.2
  "Highlight Extra" dialog:
    [+] Not closed on invalid regular expression.
    [+] Settings made persistent (stored in database).
    [+] Configurable color.

2015-04-25, v0.4.1
  [!] "Highlight Extra" dialog: help (F1) did not work.

2015-04-25, v0.4
  [*] Syntax change: bcolor->bgcolor, fcolor->fgcolor.
  [+] Highlighting of matching brackets: (), [] and {}.
      Syntax settings: bracketmatch (default=false), bracketcolor (default=0x1C).
  [+] "Highlight extra" functionality.
  [+] Syntax file: syntax_batch.lua.

2015-04-21, v0.3
  [*] Changed regex engine from Far Manager regex to Oniguruma.
      The former does not allow to specify flags for subexpressions, e.g. "(?i)".
  [!] In a macro call, if the macro had the "EnableOutput" flag, after selecting syntax via
      Plugin.Call(Guid,"own","SelectSyntax"), the editor was not redrawn.
  [!] Multi-line comments of kind {...} were treated incorrectly.
  [+] Syntax files: syntax_ini.lua, syntax_lng.lua, syntax_pascal.lua.

2014-11-11, v0.2.1
  [+] Menu "Select syntax".
  [+] Macro functions "Settings" and "SelectSyntax".
  [+] Syntax file : syntax_makefile.lua.
  [+] Macro file  : highlight.lua.

2014-11-04, v0.2
  [*] Renames in the syntax files: 'Syntax'->'Class', 'elements'->'syntax'.
  [+] New fields in the syntaxes: 'bcolor', 'fcolor'.
  [+] Dialog: "Benchmark" button and benchmark result field.
  [+] Dialog: "Lines" edit controls.
  [+] Doc files    : changelog.txt, license.txt.
  [+] Help file    : highlight_eng.hlf.
  [+] Syntax files : syntax_moonscript.lua, syntax_hlf.lua.

2014-10-23, v0.1.2
  [*] Rebuild DLL's using embedding source code processed by LuaSrcDiet, instead of LuaJIT 2.0 byte
      codes (there was a complaint from a user that the plugin would not work with LuaJIT 2.1).

2014-10-22, v0.1.1
  [!] Two libraries ('serial' and 'far2.history') were not included in v0.1; as the result,
      the plugin did not work on other people systems.

2014-10-22, v0.1
  [+] First public release.
